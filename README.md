# JDN-Picto-Cutter
This is a script that takes "pictos-sprite.css" and "pictos-sprite.png" files and cuts the pictos for UbiArt Just Dance games.
**Please note that this script is not perfect and it could make some errors.**
#Example
I've added BadRomance in the input folder. You can test the cutter with the example!
